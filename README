This repository holds various Greasemonkey user scripts I have written for myself at one point or another

On this day: This script integrates with Gmail, and lists the emails you received exactly one year ago in a little widget.
	Install from http://github.com/divergentdave/gm_scripts/raw/master/on_this_day/on_this_day.user.js

Youtube previewer: For every Youtube link on a page, this script puts the title of the video in the link's hover text.
	Install from http://github.com/divergentdave/gm_scripts/raw/master/youtube_preview/youtube_preview.user.js

Campus alert: Warns you when you visit a University of Minnesota website that is from any campus other than Twin Cities.
	Install from http://github.com/divergentdave/gm_scripts/raw/master/campus_alert/campus_alert.user.js

Read-only Facebook: This script hides almost all text boxes on Facebook, such as the status publisher, comment boxes, and the sidebar event creator. It only uses CSS, so you could alternatively add the rules to userContent.css for better performance. See the comments in the source code for instructions.
	Install from http://github.com/divergentdave/gm_scripts/raw/master/read-only_facebook/read-only_facebook.user.js, or alternatively follow the directions enclosed to put the rules in your userContent.css file.

Laundry View Classic: This script automatically redirects to the flash-free "classic mode" version of LaundryView pages.
	Install from http://github.com/divergentdave/gm_scripts/raw/master/lv_classic/lv_classic.user.js
