This repository holds various Greasemonkey user scripts I have written for myself at one point or another

On this day: This script integrates with Gmail, and lists the emails you received exactly one year ago in a little widget.

Youtube previewer: For every Youtube link on a page, this script puts the title of the video in the link's hover text.
