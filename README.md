# Greasemonkey Scripts

This repository holds various Greasemonkey user scripts I have written for myself at one point or another

### ChangeDetection Snapshot Extractor
Adds links to changedetection.com pages to grab one snapshot out of their cache. This works by comparing one version to itself.
[Install](https://github.com/divergentdave/gm_scripts/raw/master/ChangeDetection_snapshot_extractor/ChangeDetection_snapshot_extractor.user.js)

### Pull Photo
This is a utility script to help me put photos on the [Edina Robotics website](http://www.edinarobotics.com/). It's too specialized to layout and styling to be useful to anyone else, but it may be educational.

### Campus Alert
Warns you when you visit a University of Minnesota website that is from any campus other than Twin Cities.

[Install](https://github.com/divergentdave/gm_scripts/raw/master/campus_alert/campus_alert.user.js)

### Laundry View Classic
This script automatically redirects to the flash-free "classic mode" version of LaundryView pages.

[Install](https://github.com/divergentdave/gm_scripts/raw/master/lv_classic/lv_classic.user.js)

### On This Day
This script integrates with Gmail, and lists the emails you received exactly one year ago in a little widget.

[Install](https://github.com/divergentdave/gm_scripts/raw/master/on_this_day/on_this_day.user.js)
